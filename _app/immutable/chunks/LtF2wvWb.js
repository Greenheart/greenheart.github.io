Originally a rewrite of a similar project back in March 2021, I made significant improvements to create a smaller, simpler tool.

Since 2021, several other similar projects have borrowed significant parts of the code I wrote, thereby making sure this improved solution reaches many more users and developers.</p><p>This project has been a great learning opportunity to work with encryption, and creating a minimal solution and pushing the boundaries of the web platform. This knowledge has been useful in many projects since then.</p></article>");function u(e){var t=i();a(e,t)}export{u as default,o as frontmatter,p as slug};
