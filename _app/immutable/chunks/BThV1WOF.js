For tiny PDFs this can usually be solved manually, but it's not feasible to manually retype text from many PDF pages. Especially not as part of a data pipeline processing many thousands of documents.</p><p>Luckily, there are ways to automate the text extraction by using Optical Character Recognition (<!>) software.</p><p>One great example is the open source program <!>, which in turn is built on top of <!>. The best thing about this tool compared to others is that it runs completely locally on your computer which allows you to keep sensitive data private. Since it's a command-line tool, it's easy to automate and process many files in parallel.</p><p><code>ocrmypdf</code> can usually be <!> to let you start using it. Though, as always, make sure you are installing from a reputable source, or build the program yourself from the source code.</p><h2>Using <code>ocrmypdf</code> to extract text from PDFs</h2><p>If you only need to extract text from PDF files with English content, you can use the default language pack which usually comes preinstalled.</p><p>Here's how to perform OCR on a PDF with English content:</p><!><p>If some pages have text content already, you can skip them with <code>--skip-text</code>:</p><!><h2>Using specific languages</h2><p>If you need support for additional languages, you can <!>. If you for example want to use German, you would <!> the <code>deu</code> language pack and then use it like this:</p><!><p>If you want both German and English, you can enable multiple language packs:</p><!><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>These commands usually solve most cases for me with great results. Even though it's not always perfect, the output from <code>ocrmypdf</code> is a much better starting point for manually reviewing the PDF texts when it's important to make 100% correct conversions.</p><p>There are also plenty of options to explore with <code>ocrmypdf</code> to improve your results. If you find cases where it doesn't work, both <code>ocrmypdf</code> and <code>tesseract</code> are open source projects that could become even better with your contributions. In other cases, there are other OCR tools available, many of which are libre software. However, I've not needed them so far.</p></article>");function G(w){var d=A(),u=e(p(d)),k=e(p(u));r(k,{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition",children:(t,l)=>{a();var o=n("OCR");s(t,o)},$$slots:{default:!0}}),a(),c(u);var h=e(u),y=e(p(h));r(y,{href:"https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF",children:(t,l)=>{a();var o=n("OCRmyPDF");s(t,o)},$$slots:{default:!0}});var _=e(y,2);r(_,{href:"https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract",children:(t,l)=>{a();var o=n("Tesseract");s(t,o)},$$slots:{default:!0}}),a(),c(h);var m=e(h),$=e(p(m),2);r($,{href:"https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html",children:(t,l)=>{a();var o=n("installed with one command");s(t,o)},$$slots:{default:!0}}),a(),c(m);var g=e(m,4);i(g,{codeHTML:`<pre class="shiki one-dark-pro" style="background-color:#282c34;color:#abb2bf" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#61AFEF">ocrmypdf</span><span style="color:#98C379"> in.pdf</span><span style="color:#98C379"> out.pdf</span></span>
