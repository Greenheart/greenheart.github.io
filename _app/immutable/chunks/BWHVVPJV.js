For tiny PDFs this can usually be solved manually, but it's not feasible to manually re-type text from many PDF pages. Especially not as part of a data pipeline processing many thousands of documents.</p><p>Luckily, there are ways to automate the text extraction by using Optical Character Recognition (<!>) software.</p><p>One great example is the open source program <!>, which in turn is built on top of <!>. The best thing about this tool compared to others is that it runs completely locally on your computer which allows you to keep sensitive data private. Since it's a command-line tool, it's easy to automate and process many files in parallel.</p><p><code>ocrmypdf</code> can usually be <!> to let you start using it. Though, as always, make sure you are installing from a reputable source, or build the program yourself from the source code.</p><h2>Using <code>ocrmypdf</code> to extract text from PDFs</h2><p>If you only need to extract text from PDF files with English content, you can use the default language pack which usually comes preinstalled.</p><p>Here's how to perform OCR on a PDF with English content:</p><!><p>If some pages have text content already, you can skip them with <code>--skip-text</code>:</p><!><h2>Using specific languages</h2><p>If you need support for additional languages, you can <!>. If you for example want to use German, you would <!> the <code>deu</code> language pack and then use it like this:</p><!><p>If you want both German and English, you can enable multiple language packs:</p><!><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>These commands usually solve most cases for me with great results. Even though it's not always perfect, the output from <code>ocrmypdf</code> is a much better starting point for manually reviewing the PDF texts when it's important to make 100% correct conversions.</p><p>There are also plenty of options to explore with <code>ocrmypdf</code> to improve your results. If you find cases where it doesn't work, both <code>ocrmypdf</code> and <code>tesseract</code> are open source projects that could become even better with your contributions. In other cases, there are other OCR tools available, many of which are libre software.
