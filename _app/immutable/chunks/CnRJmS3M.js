These allow near instantaneous navigation when visiting the most commonly used bookmarks.</p><p>It's worth noting that this feature is missing in Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers such as Edge.</p><h2>How to Use Firefox Bookmark Keywords</h2><p>To open a commonly visited bookmark by using its keyword:</p><ol><li>Open a new tab with <code>CTRL/CMD + T</code>.</li><li>Type a single character to find the right bookmark using a keyword. For example <code>c</code> for calendar. This will make the bookmark appear as the selected suggestion in the address bar.</li><li>Press <code>ENTER</code> to open.</li></ol><p>Since this can be done with just the keyboard and only requires 4 keystrokes, this really helps when you want to stay in the flow. Focus on what to do with the bookmarked website instead of how to open it.</p><h2>Add Bookmark Keywords to Websites You Visit Often</h2><ol><li>Open the Firefox Bookmarks Library with <code>CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + O</code>.</li><li>Add a new bookmark, or edit one of your favorites.</li><li>Click on the bookmark to view detailed fields, and you will find <code>Keywords</code> at the bottom.</li><li>In the <code>Keywords</code> field, enter a single character or single word keyword that you want to use. For example, I use <code>c</code> for calendar and <code>m</code> for mail.</li><li>The bookmarks automatically save as you edit them, so once you've added the keyword you want, you can try it out using the steps above. Enjoy!</li></ol><p>Given how much time is spent in the browser, searching for information or using web apps, it's well worth learning how to use the browser efficiently. What's your best browser productivity tip?</p></article>");function m(o){var e=s();i(o,e)}export{m as default,r as frontmatter,c as headings,l as slug};
