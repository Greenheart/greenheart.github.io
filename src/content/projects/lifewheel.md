Reflect on Your Life Balance. Local-first, privacy-friendly web app for your personal well-being. Built for the [SvelteHack 2023](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/2023), and developed since then. Using this regularly with friends and family.

Unique features include a backwards compatible data format, cross-device sync and merging of sessions from different devices. Data can be synced via files, links, and even by scanning a QR code. Your data can be end-to-end encrypted to keep personal and sensitive information safe.
