Fullstack e-commerce system for a local bakery with backend, API, public frontend and admin dashboard. Focus on comprehensive testing and delivering a simple but effective solution that is easy to self-host and maintain.

Automatic OpenAPI documentation generated from the backend code, always in sync with the implementation. This in turn enables type safety for the clients via [openapi-fetch](https://openapi-ts.dev/openapi-fetch/) and simple refactoring, allowing the project to change and grow to handle new requirements. Also featuring a minimal dependency injection solution that gives 80% of the benefits with only 20% of the code compared to other third-party packages.
