Garbo is powered by LLMs to fetch and extract self-reported [GHG emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHG_Protocol_Corporate_Standard) data from companies. It automates the process of data extraction, evaluation, and formatting, providing a streamlined workflow for handling environmental data.

I mainly worked on implementing the data pipeline, creating the initial database design and a self-documenting REST-API for both internal and external use. I also worked on frontend development for presenting the resulting emissions, trying to make it easy to understand the complex data.
