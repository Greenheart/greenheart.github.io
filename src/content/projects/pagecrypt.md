Password protected Single Page Applications and HTML files, built using the Web Crypto API. Originally a rewrite of a similar project back in March 2021, I made significant improvements to create a smaller, simpler tool. At the time, this was the first public open source project to use the Web Crypto API for password protected HTML files. Since 2021, several other similar projects has borrowed significant parts of the code I wrote, thereby making sure this improved solution reaches many more users and developers.

This project has been a great learning opportunity to work with encryption, and creating a minimal solution pushing the boundaries of what the web platform can do. This knowledge has been useful in many projects since then.
