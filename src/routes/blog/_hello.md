This will be a good start. Just check this code sample:

```ts
function foo(bar) {
    var a = 42,
        b = 'Prism'
    return a + bar(b)
}
```

## Development goals

1. Rapid development with modern tooling (Svelte, Vite, Tailwind CSS)
2. Good performance for the built static site.
3. Minimal runtime overhead to boost pageloads for the blog.
